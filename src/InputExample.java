/*
abstraction.  how things work inside a thing that you dont need to be aware of to use the thing
encapsulation.  things can contain things, they got boundaries that you can put things in binding data and methods together
inheritance.  retrieving things from the parents. public class (child) extends (parent) format will do that
polymorphism.  one thing can have many forms. in different places.

1. creat a class that is a shape class, and more classes that are children of the shape.
2. program that will find area and perimeter of shapes.
